# Financial Fraud Detection – Research Project

This repository contains the implementation of a research project on **Financial Fraud Detection** using real-world transaction data. The project was conducted as part of an academic research initiative at **KLE Technological University**, and the resulting paper has been submitted to **CISCom2025-MDPI Journal Computer Science and Mathematics Forum**.

## Project Overview

- **Timeline:** February 2025 – June 2025
- **Team Size:** 4 Members
- **Objective:** Detect fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning techniques, with a focus on exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
- **Submission:** CISCom2025--Paper Submission for MDPI Journal Computer Science and Mathematics Forum

## Key Tasks

- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns and anomalies.
- Applied advanced **data preprocessing techniques** to address class imbalance and outliers.
- Compared multiple machine learning models to identify the most effective in detecting fraud.

## Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest
