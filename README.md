# Financial Fraud Detection – Research Project

This repository contains the implementation of a research project on **Financial Fraud Detection** using a publicly available transaction dataset. The project was conducted as part of an academic research initiative at **KLE Technological University**.

The resulting paper was submitted to the **CISCom2025 – MDPI Computer Science and Mathematics Forum**, **accepted in the top 20% of submissions**, and **presented during the First International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Soft Computing (CISCom 2025)** held on **26–27 November 2025**.

## Project Overview

- **Timeline:** February 2025 – June 2025
- **Team Size:** 4 Members
